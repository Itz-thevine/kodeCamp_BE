Create a command line-based guessing game, the game should guess a random number between 1 and 10, 
accept your input (a number you guess within the range of 1 to 10), 
compare your input with the random number generated.

 

If the inputs are same, the output should be “You have won!”

 

If the imputs are not the same the output should be “You have lost! 
The random number generated is <randomNumber>”.

 

"<randomNumber>" is a placeholder (where the random number generated by NodeJS should be placed).
